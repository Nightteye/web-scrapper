Web Scrapper
This is a simple web scrapper built using Python and BeautifulSoup. It allows you to scrape data from a website and save it in a CSV file.
Installation To install the required libraries, run the following command:
```pip install -r requirements.txt
```     Usage To use the web scrapper, run the following command:
```python web_scrapper.py
```
This will start the web scrapper and it will prompt you to enter the URL of the website you want to scrape. After you enter the URL, it will scrape the data and save it in a CSV file named "scraped_data.csv".
Note: Make sure to have the required permissions to scrape the website and respect the website's robots
.txt file.
